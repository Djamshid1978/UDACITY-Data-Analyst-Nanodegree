Project 6: Make Effective Data Visualization 

  

## Summary: 

  

The goal of this graphical chart is to show an effective visualization of the ratio of survived and dead passengers by class in the historical tragedy sunken the Titanic, which contains samples (891 out of total 2,224 people including passengers and crew on board). 

With the presented graphical visualization it is visible that higher classes were top priorities to be put on lifeboats. 

  

## Design: 

  

I chose a stacked bar chart type to best visualize the outcomes of each passenger on the Titanic, separated by passenger class. 

As there is only two survivorship categories, so the layout of stacked bar chart is the best way to visualize the data. 

Since data are represented in the ratio, legend and labeling texts let the audience clearly understand the graphs and find out actual ration of survived passengers. 

  

  

## Feedback: 

  

Reviewer 1. Header are shown in the graph need to move center then x_axis text is slightly cut off, adjustment is required. 

  

Reviewer 2. It is better to see the ratio value of the passengers in each bar by class.   

  

Revier 3.  Color in the vertical stacked bar chart can be improved.
